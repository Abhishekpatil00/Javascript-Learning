console.log(null>02)
console.log("2">1)
console.log(null==0) // conversion and comparison like this are confusing so not to use them
console.log(null>=0) // in operations like >= or <= null is treated as number i.e 0 

// === : this is strict check this not only checks the value but also it's datatype
console.log("2"===2);
